# Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would
# use each type of test.

# Answer - 
# t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown or either sample size is less then 30 whereas the z-test is used when the population standard deviation
# is known and sample size is greater than 30.

# # for example -  Q7. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample of data with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation
# of 5. Interpret the results.

# In the below example the sample size is 50 then we will use the Z test but if the sample size is less than 30 then we will use the t-test.
