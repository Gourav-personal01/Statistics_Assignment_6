# Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.

# the Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of the conditions that might be relevant to the event.

# Example - find the price (y) of a house where the size of house,no of rooms,location is given as x1,x2,x3. 

# p(y/x1,x2,x3) = p(y) * p(x1,x2,x3/y)/ p(x1,x2,x3)
