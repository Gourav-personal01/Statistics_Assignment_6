# Q8. What is the margin of error in a confidence interval? How does sample size affect the margin of error?
# Provide an example of a scenario where a larger sample size would result in a smaller margin of error.


# margin of error is the values which provides a range of estiimated value where the unknown population should e lies.

# sample size affects the margin of error as the larger the sample size so, there would be less standard error and smaller margin of error.

# Suppose we are doing a survey and in that Each time you survey one more person, the cost of your survey increases, 
# and going from a sample size of, say, 1,500 to a sample size of 2,000 decreases your margin of error by only 0.34% (one third of one percent!)
#  â€” from 0.0253 (which we get from 1500 sample) to 0.0219 (which we get from 2000 sample )
