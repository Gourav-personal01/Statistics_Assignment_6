# Q6. Use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge of the
# event's probability and new evidence. Provide a sample problem and solution.


# Answer - 

# Consider We have given size of house (x1),no of rooms (x2),location (x3) 
# Now we have to find the price (y) using bayes theorem.

# p(y/x1,x2,x3) = p(y) * p(x1,x2,x3/y)/ p(x1,x2,x3)
